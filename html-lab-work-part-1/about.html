            <h1>What you need to know about us !</h1>
            <a> In the world of tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, various types of dice are used to
                determine
                outcomes, create randomness, and add an element of chance to the game. Each type of die serves a
                specific purpose in the
                game mechanics.</a>

            <h3 id="Origine">Origine of the Dice</h3>
            <a>Dice have been used since before recorded history, and it is uncertain where they originated. It is
                theorized that dice
                developed from the practice of fortune-telling with the talus of hoofed animals, colloquially known as
                knucklebones.
                The Egyptian game of senet (played before 3000 BCE and up to the 2nd century CE) was played with flat
                two-sided
                throwsticks which indicated the number of squares a player could move, and thus functioned as a form of
                dice. Perhaps
                the oldest known dice were excavated as part of a backgammon-like game set at the Burnt City, an
                archeological site in
                south-eastern Iran, estimated to be from between 2800 and 2500 BCE.</a>
